# DDPM from Scratch – 100% Solo (Dec 2025 – Jan 2026)

Former pro soccer player rebuilding diffusion from the ground up so every word on my resume is true.  
Goal: MNIST → CIFAR-10 → 64×64 faces with zero AI code generation.

## Why this repo exists
My senior design team used some AI assistance on our DDPM facial-generation project.  
I will be learning how to compile DDPM from scratch

## Timeline
- Week 1 (Dec 9–15): Perfect MNIST digits  
- Week 2 (Dec 16–22): CIFAR-10 32×32 → FID ≤ 35  
- Week 3–4 (Dec 23–Jan 9): 64×64 CelebA-HQ faces + Gradio demo

Daily commits. 
When I’m done, I’ll be able to whiteboard every equation and run live generation.
